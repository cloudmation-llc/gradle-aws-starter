# AWS Starter Template for Gradle

A template project demonstrating quick set up for AWS using Gradle and the [Infrastructure Plugins](https://github.com/cloudmation-llc/gradle-infrastructure-plugins).

**Update October 2020: I have switched over to using the AWS CDK for client work, and I recommended that you do the same. This was a fun, experimental project to work on. This repository has been replaced in archival read-only mode.**
